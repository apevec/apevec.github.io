# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## Previous Repository Setup

EPEL update policy does not allow incompatbile upgrades, so we had to
keep OpenStack Folsom in EPEL6.

Inofficial branches el6-* in pkgs.fedoraproject.org were created:
* el6-grizzly from f19
* el6-havana from f20
* el6-icehouse from f21

---

# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## Current Repository Setup

OpenStack Folsom was retired from EPEL6 and all el6* branches are now blocked.

In order to keep packaging in pkgs.fedoraproject.org EL6 changes were merged
to the corresponding Fedora branch, f20 for Havana, f21 for Icehouse:

    %if 0%{?rhel} == 6
    Requires(post):   chkconfig
    Requires(postun): initscripts
    ...
    %else
    Requires(post): systemd
    ...
    %endif

# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## Current Buildsystem Setup

* RDO Fedora is built in Koji, Fedora N+1 builds are made available

  for Fedora N e.g. RDO Icehouse for Fedora 20 are Fedora 21 builds



* RDO EL is currently built in Copr, example for Icehouse EL7 [1]

  RDO EL depends on EPEL.

# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## rdopkg update YAML

RDO package builds are grouped into updates and described in YAML files.
Example https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdo-update/blob/master/updates/00fz.yml

    ---
    notes: |
        Tighten permissions for /var/log/neutron and /var/lib/neutron/
        Added conntrack-tools to dependencies
    builds:
      - id: openstack-neutron-2014.2-5.fc22
        repo: juno
        source: koji
        dist: fedora-21
      - id: openstack-neutron-2014.2-5.el7
        source: copr-jruzicka
        repo: juno
        dist: epel-7

# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## rdopkg CI

Updates are pushed as Gerrit updates which trigger a series of CI jobs.

* Phase1

  Install packages from update YAML on the snapshot image with
  the all-in-one OpenStack installation, starts services and runs
  Tempest smoketest. Tests basic package sanity and upgrade.

* Phase2

  Runs from-the-scratch all-in-one installation with all the packages
  which passed Phase1. Tests package interaction among queued updates.

* stage daily jobs and on-demand before pushing queued updates list

* production daily job to catch regressions in dependency changes

# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## Delorean

https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/delorean-packages

Tracks upstream trunk i.e. currently Kilo.

Breaks when upstream change requires packaging changes and alerts the package
owner as defined in https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo

Going forward, all packaging changes will be done in Delorean packages first,
and merged to Fedora Rawhide around milestone times.

## Next Steps

* rdopkg on github

* rdo-update on gerrithub

* rdopkg CI on a public Jenkins instance
