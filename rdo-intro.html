# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## Previous Repository Setup

EPEL update policy does not allow incompatbile upgrades, so we had to
keep OpenStack Folsom in EPEL6.

Inofficial branches el6-* in pkgs.fedoraproject.org were created:
* el6-grizzly from f19
* el6-havana from f20
* el6-icehouse from f21

---

# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## Current Repository Setup

OpenStack Folsom was retired from EPEL6 and all el6* branches are now blocked.

In order to keep packaging in pkgs.fedoraproject.org EL6 changes were merged
to the corresponding Fedora branch, f20 for Havana, f21 for Icehouse:

    %if 0%{?rhel} == 6
    Requires(post):   chkconfig
    Requires(postun): initscripts
    ...
    %else
    Requires(post): systemd
    ...
    %endif

# RDO Introduction For Contributors
## Current Buildsystem Setup

* RDO Fedora is built in Koji, Fedora N+1 builds are made available

  for Fedora N e.g. RDO Icehouse for Fedora 20 are Fedora 21 builds



* RDO EL is currently built in Copr, example for Icehouse EL7 [1]

  RDO EL depends on EPEL.
